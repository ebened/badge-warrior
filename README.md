## How does badge warrior do this?

Badge warrior is a page where users are awarded badges. The user with the most amount of badges is tracked on a leaderboard (possibly live?). If any user does absolutely nothing for a set amount of time the entire site shuts down or is replaced with something simple as someone beat badge warrior. (e.g. titled icons) for almost anything they do, such as moving their mouse over any part of the page, typing anything, clicking on anything, dragging their mouse around, etc. The users are also awarded badges for things they don't strictly do, such as having stayed on the page for a certain amount of time, having done nothing for a certain amount of time, having gotten a badge (e.g. recieving a badge for having recieved a badge). 

These badges are accounted for in a few different ways: they are visually represented when they are generated, they are visually stored at the top of the page, they are tabulated by a badge counter.

Potentially there will be leaderboards where people will be competing with one another in order to 


### User window
#### The user window is what the page in its entirety is called. This is where a user ends up when connecting to the badge warrior url. This window is divided into two general parts:

##### 1. The Arena
**The Arena** is where the user may interact with the page. This area is divided into many different equally sized 'Blocks'.

* `Blocks`

Blocks are areas of a consistently defined size with unique ids. As a user interacts with these blocks (i.e. mouseover, click, drag) a badge is potentially generated. The generated badge is stored visually on the 'refridgerator'.

##### 2. The Refridgerator
**The Refridgerator** is where all the badges are represented to the user visually. This is partitioned off from **The Arena** the moment the user interacts with the **User Window**. This would possibly be about a 5th of the top of the entire page.
